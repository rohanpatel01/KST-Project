      <p>As a swami, Jinabhai’s enthusiasm for seva grew to an astonishing level. He would rise early and retire to bed late sweeping around the mandir or doing the vasans. He later earned the name Yogiji. Once meeting his guru, Shastriji Maharaj, together they spread the principles of Akshar Purushottam. Shortly before Shastriji Maharaj’s death, he renounced that Yogiji Maharaj would be the next president of the sanstha. During this time, Yogiji Maharaj’s love for youth was shown when he established youth sabha, in 1952. These sabhas gave opportunities for youth to grow spiritually, find life long friends, receive advice from adults and youth, as well as imbibe spiritual lessons in a more well suited environment. Throughout the past 70 years, new mandirs have sprouted in all 4 corners of the world, allowing for millions of youth to fulfil their spiritual needs.. If not for Yogiji Mahahraj’s love for children, millions of balaks, kishores, and yuvaks would be spiritually stranded on an island floating in the middle of the vast ocean of maya. Through sabha these youths have been guided spiritually as well as academically. I will be focusing on the moments before, during, and after Yogiji Maharaj created youth sabha. This event has impacted my life tremendously by giving me a sense of hope, connecting me with hundreds of kishore's around north america, and allowed me to find my purpose in life. If not for sabha, only bhagwan would know how truly lost I would be in this world. </p>
