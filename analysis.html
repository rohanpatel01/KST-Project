      <p>The first few seeds that Yogiji Maharaj planted during his travels across India and Africa sprouted slowly through relentless hard work and everlasting passion. Taking a step back and seeing how far this one dream had progressed is incredible. Over 70 years this santhsa has grown from a feeble sapling into a network of forests. Believe it or not, the youths that Yogiji Maharaj had poured his heart into had contributed in the building of these mandirs: as well as ensuring that their youth gained an understanding for satsang. Without this momentous event that he had brought us, there would not be such a vast array of mandirs around the world, much less the millions of satsangis that are now connected to Bhagwan Swaminarayan through youth sabha.</p>

      <p>When Yogiji Maharaj created youth sabha it resulted in changing the course of satsang on a colossal scale. A simple dream to create a frim bond within youths to satsang has branched out and resulted in hundreds of different major impacts that have guided satsang into what it has become today. Within these hundreds of impacts there is one that is particularly unique. The values that are taught to our youth. Before youth sabha, children had nowhere to learn moral values other than the day to day lessons which their parents have taught them. Through youth sabha, youths have been instilled with 6 core values which help guide their moral compass. In addition to strengthening the value of their lives, these values have brought change to satsang through serving others in need and spreading the values they have learned to better the lives of those they have met. These 6 values of the BAPS youth wing are sanghnishtha (unity), sayam (self-control, discipline), seva (service), sanskar (good character), satsang (spirituality) and guru bhakti (devotion to guru). Starting with unity, the root of unity is swarupnishtha, firm faith in god and the satpurush. This unity is also taught to keep samp with the balaks, kishores, and yuvaks which they interact with. Next is Sayam, or self control. This value has ensured that the youth of BAPS will repel away from additions and adhere to the niyams Bhagwan Swaminarayan has given them; these youth are able to spread the light of an addiction free life as well as imbibe character within the people they meet on their travels. Third and fourth are Seva (Service) and Sanskar (Good Character). These two values go hand in hand as they allow them to serve others and do the right thing no matter what difficult they encounter. Next is spirituality. Through having immense faith in Bhagwan Swaminarayan they have worked through hardship to help others. This has taught these youths to preserve courage and faith within their communities during difficult times. Finally we have Guru Bhakti, or devotion to guru. Within this materialistic world these youths have realized that the only way to find true happiness in this world is to find love within the satpurush through worship. By understanding the satpurush and developing deep affection towards him, you will be happy wherever you are. Once you combine these values you will notice that the impacts that this has created upon satsang are numerous: creating samp within youth, allowing these youth to serve their community, all while doing it selflessly and wholeheartedly, and not to mention deepen their roots via thorough understanding and spreading their knowledge onto future satsangis and its messages to those who are in need. Without giving balaks, kishores, and yuvaks the knowledge of satsang, this sanstha would be missing a massive part of what itâ€™s made up of. Through these youth and their involvement within satsang and the communities that lie around, the values held within the scripts of the vachanamrut have stabilized itself within the furthest edges of this world and embedded itself within a multitude of diverse cultures.</p>
