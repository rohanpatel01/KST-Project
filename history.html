      <p>Before the love of Yogiji Maharaj manifested itself through sabha, youths normally sat among adults in weekly spiritual gatherings. Although there were a handful of youths that gained knowledge from these gatherings, many were lost within the words of the presenter. The same knowledge was given to both youths and adults in a way only adults could comprehend easily. Complex topics such as the 5 entities, the different forms of karmas, or the difference between the atma and jiva would completely fly above the understanding of these youths. Luckily, some youths were able to experience the sukh from satsang through Yogiji Maharaj. He would constantly be interacting with youths during his travels. Whether it be giving balaks darshan, sing doon, or do katha. He would also gather a group of 20-30 youths, tell them to split into groups, and assign projects to complete. One group would be given a vachanamrut to memorize, another a swamini vato or a kirtan. Little by little, Yogiji Maharaj instilled satsang values within these children and teenagers. Through these interactions he allowed them to create and maintain their bonds with satsang. And it may be difficult to detect but these were the original forms of youth sabha. It wasnâ€™t until Ishwarcharan swami blessed this wish in Bombay that he would become a sanchalak and create youth sabha.</p>
