      <p>In summary, the small seed that Yogiji Maharaj had planted in Mumbai has caused a chain reaction spreading from India to Africa, and later within North America. Before youth sabha’s creation, children did not have a strong connection to satsang. They gained knowledge through prasangs and teachings discussed by their parents but not much outside that. The moments shared among the handful of youth with Yogiji Maharaj during his travels was the most similar experience to what satsang had been for children. Through his cheerful nature and warm smile, Yogiji Maharaj used his undying passion to give children and youth a place in Satsang to thrive. Starting with only a few yuvak mandals across Mumbai he managed to make this small dream into a world wide reality. The growth resulting from the additional mandirs and essentially the addition of youth to satsang has been exponential. The youth wing has connected millions of balaks, kishores, and vuvaks from around the world and focused their efforts toward one motive, pleasing Bhagwan. Through the samp that these youth have created for one another they have been able to collectify their strengths and aid hundreds of thousands of individuals: including spreading the message of Satsang across 350 villages, freeing 1100+ individuals from addictions, giving relief to earthquake victims, and so much more has been completed within the hands of the youth. Through these efforts, youths have made tremendous positive impacts around the world in the name of BAPS.</p>

      <p>When I think about the significance of youth sabha my mind always goes back to one specific prasang of Ghanshyam Maharaj when he was a child. When asked why he’d rather be constantly engrossed in satsang than playing with the other kids outside, Ghanshyam said that we should start satsang at a young age. When refuted by the claim,” you can immerse in satsang when you're old”, he walked around his village and noticed that many adults spend their Sundays indulging in addictions such as bhang. Although the belief that childhood should be saved for fun and relaxation is true to some extent, if we do not instill the values taught from our gurus into children at a young age they will not develop such a strong passion for satsang that youth today hold within their hearts. I chose the topic of Yogiji Maharaj creating youth sabha for two reasons. One, the addition of the youth wing has created a monumental difference within satsang. By influencing satsangis at a young age we allow them to bloom into the leaders that will carry the traditions and teaching of BAPS well into the future. And two, sabha is what allowed me to find a purpose and a sense of peace within my life. I would not have met the friends I have in mandir, networked with hundreds of kishores around North America, and gained the level of knowledge about my culture and religion if it had not been for sabha. All things considered, I am eternally grateful that Yogiji Maharaj spent his valuable time and energy to create an environment where I can feel welcome, gain knowledge about satsang, and find happiness within this world of uncertainty.</p>
