      <p>When devotees think of Yogiji Maharaj they instinctively remember his affectionate smile and his undying love for the youth. He held the development for youth as his highest priority, ensuring that the future leaders and devotees would keep the values of BAPS at heart for generations to come. In 1952, Yogiji Maharaj established the first BAPS youth wing, manifesting his love for youth in a way never before seen. He created a specialized environment in which the devotees and future leaders of BAPS could grow spiritually. Yogiji Maharaj initialized youth sabha by creating a yuvak mandal in Mumbai. Although the beginning was difficult, the first official sabha only had 6 yuvaks. Center by center, he would go around and initialize these sabhas; if one center would fail he would restart the program. Slowly and through undying passion more yuvak mandals were started. Over years many centers began sprouting from the seeds that Yogiji Maharah had planted: spanning across Kampala, Mbale, and Gulu in Uganda, London, Nairobi, Mombasa, Jinja, Toronto, Nakura, Kisumu, Mwanza, Dar-es-Salaam, Gondal, Vidyanagar, Mumbai, and Kolkata. These seeds connected the UK, USA, Africa, Middle East,India, as well as the Asia Pacific region. Along the way many shibirs and adhiveshans allowed these regions to connect and strengthen their satsang knowledge through interactive mediums. Itâ€™s events like the first Yuvak Shibir in Atladra (1955), the first Adhiveshan in Nairobi, Kenya (1956), the first national adhiveshan in Atladra, Gujarat, India (1969), the first karyakar shibir in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India (1976), and the first international Yuvak adhivesha (1990), which highlight the significance of youth sabha and allow us to understand the gift that Yogiji maharaj has blessed us with.</p>
